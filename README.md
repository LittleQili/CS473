## Homework

### HW1

The homework is about implementing RBFKernel in CUDA, and try to optimize it.

Source code and report can be found [here](https://github.com/LittleQili/CS473/tree/main/cuda/hw1).

### HW2

The homework is about to draw a three-color-triangle.

Source code of [CUDA and C++](https://github.com/LittleQili/CS473/tree/main/cuda/hw2), [OpenGL](https://github.com/LittleQili/CS473/tree/main/opengl/hw2)

### HW3

The homework is about to draw the Voronoi diagram and Delauny triangulation.

Source code of [CUDA](https://github.com/LittleQili/CS473/tree/main/cuda/hw3): naive and jump flood algorithm; draw Delauny triangles.

Source code of [OpenGL](https://github.com/LittleQili/CS473/tree/main/opengl/hw3): naive algorithm

## Project

The first part is to change the [mesh segmentation network structure](https://colab.research.google.com/github/tensorflow/graphics/blob/master/tensorflow_graphics/notebooks/mesh_segmentation_demo.ipynb) to get higher performance. The final version of the network can be found [here](https://github.com/LittleQili/CS473/blob/main/tfgraphics/my_mesh_segmentation_demo_indrive.ipynb).

The second part is to do subdivision of  the mesh. [My work](https://github.com/LittleQili/CS473/tree/main/tfgraphics/MeshSubdivision) is referred to [ozkanyumsak's work](https://github.com/ozkanyumsak/mesh-subdivision).

Report can be found [here](https://github.com/LittleQili/CS473/blob/main/tfgraphics/report.pdf) (Only Chinese version).
